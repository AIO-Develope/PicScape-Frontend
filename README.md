### For the complete functionality of this project, the [backend](https://github.com/AIO-Develope/PicScape-Backend) is essential.

## Project Status
PicScape is a relatively new project and it may currently lack some functionality and features. However, I am continually improving the project in the future. Additionally, PicScape will be available as a fully functional service in the future, ready for you to use.
